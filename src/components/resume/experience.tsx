        "During this internship, I was responsible for building a web application to replace the traditional paperwork used by production line supervisors to communicate their requests and reports to various departments. The goal was to provide a convenient and efficient digital solution. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather requirements throughout the development process, ensuring a solid and effective outcome. I used Next.js for its ability to handle both frontend and backend logic, which allowed me to build a high-performing, modern, and user-friendly application. I also implemented JWT for secure operations. This experience strengthened my problem-solving abilities and gave me valuable insight into enterprise-level project management.",

This project deepened my development expertise by challenging me with new technical problems and significantly enhanced my skill setâ€”preparing me for more advanced professional projects.",
